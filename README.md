Orbital 2022 Artemis Project

Hey everyone! When we first brainstormed about what kind of orbital project we wanted to do, we thought long and hard about how we could contribute to the school with our application. Something that has not been done before, and one that would benefit the student population greatly. 

In year 1, we took many modules involving different communication platforms between students. Examples would be the use of piazza / coursemology / various telegram groups or discord channels for discussion and information sharing. Due to the numerous channels for different modules, it can really get confusing at times. Therefore, we decided to create a centralised platform for communication, where students can select the modules that they are taking that semester, and communicate with other students in a group chat. With one platform for all modules, it will make it extremely easy for students to ask questions pertaining to their modules. We designed our application with that goal in mind and faced numerous difficulties along the way. This is after all our first foray into full-stack development, and through it all, we felt that it was extremely challenging to come up with a full product from scratch. 

Due to the idea of our application being novel, it was difficult for us to find resources online to properly integrate certain processes together, but perseverance is definitely a must in software engineering.

Through it all, we are proud of what we have achieved and how far we have come. Our group understands that our application may not be the most ideal, with many more improvements that can be made. But we firmly believe that Orbital is an opportunity for us to learn at a pace that we are comfortable with, and it is more about the process than the outcome. 

We humbly present to you, ConnectiNUS, proudly developed by Linus Chan and Ivan Chin.
